### Hi! I'm Sam Casey <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
#### A Software Engineer from Boston, MA

I'm passionate about using my combination of business and tech skills to help others. I'm interested in crypto, entrepreneurship, and the creator economy. I'm a former finance and strategy analyst turned software engineer, and I have been teaching myself to code since early 2019. I graduated from a General Assembly bootcamp in November of 2020 and have been working to improve my skills and find a way to make an impact with code since.
