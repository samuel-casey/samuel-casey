# Hi! I'm Sam Casey <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm an entrepreneurial Software Engineer from Boston, MA passionate about using my combination of business and tech skills to help others.  I'm a former finance and strategy analyst turned software engineer, and I have been teaching myself to code since early 2019. I spent early 2020 helping seed-stage startups with web design and development, and I graduated from a General Assembly bootcamp in November of 2020. Since GA, I have been working to improve my skills through project-based learning. I'm currently looking for a new software engineering role and hoping to join an entrepreneurial team that pushes each other to grow daily.
