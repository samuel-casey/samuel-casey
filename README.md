### Hi!I'm Sam Casey<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
#### A Software Engineer from Boston, MA

I'm passionate about using my combination of business and tech skills to help others. In the past, I worked at Fidelity Investments as a Senior Strategy Analyst and as a team member of two-internal startups. I started teaching myself to code in early 2019 while still at Fidelity in order to make my work in Excel easier. What started as a few lines of SQL and Python code turned into a passion for using code to express myself and solve business problems. I left Fidelity in January of 2019 to dive deeper into code, and flex my entrepreneurial muscles by helping early-stage startups with prototyping and business strategy.
