### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sam Casey
#### An Entrepreneurially Minded Software Engineer from Boston, MA

I'm a self-taught software engineer with a passion for using my combination of business and tech skills to help others. In the past, I worked at Fidelity Investments as a Senior Strategy Analyst and as a team member of two-internal startups. I started teaching myself to code in early 2019 while still at Fidelity in order to make my work in Excel easier. What started as a few lines of SQL and Python code turned into a passion for using code to express myself and solve business problems. I left Fidelity in January of 2019 to dive deeper into code, and flex my entrepreneurial muscles by using what I learned about UI/UX design and startup strategy at Fidelity and Babson College in my own company, River Interactive.
